# ðŸŽ¨ Video Palette Generator

> _Unlike certain AI companies that shall remain nameless (cough_ Pear.ai _cough), we actually write our own code and respect open source!_

## What is this?

A totally legitimate, definitely-not-stolen tool that extracts color palettes from your videos. Yes, we actually wrote this ourselves, shocking right? In an era where some companies think "open source" means "free real estate", we're keeping it real.

## Features

- Drag & drop video processing (because we're not monsters who make you use the command line)
- Generates up to 256 colors (that's like, way more than you'll ever need)
- Downloads palettes as PNG (perfect for your "inspired by" projects)
- 100% original code (we know, we're as surprised as you are)

## How to Use

1. Drop a video
2. Wait for magic
3. Get colors
4. Don't steal this code and claim you wrote it

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

(These commands actually work, unlike some companies' documentation)

## Tech Stack

- React (because we're basic)
- Web Workers (for actual parallel processing, not just marketing buzzwords)
- Canvas API (for pixel manipulation, not manipulating the open source community)

## License

See LICENSE file. Yes, we have one. Yes, it matters. No, we didn't "forget" to include it.

## Disclaimer

No open source projects were harmed in the making of this tool. We can't say the same for our sense of humor.
